Install Vite first, since it sets up a project folder:

Install guide - vitejs.dev/guide -

npx degit user/project my-project
cd my-project
npm install
npm run dev  # which runs it as well

Then install threejs @ 0.26.1 for this space-invader project -
npm i three@0.126.1

// Option 1: Import the entire three.js core library.
import * as THREE from 'three';
